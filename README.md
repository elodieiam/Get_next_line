# get_next_line project 📖
The **get_next_line** project involves writing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time. 📜

The project helps improving our skills in file input/ouput operations, dynamic memory allocation and buffer management.

By creating this function we get a deeper understanding of how to handle input efficiency in C.

## Features 📋
- **File reading:** Read from a file descriptor one line at a time
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Efficiently manage memory for variable-length lines
- **Buffer Management:** Handle input using a static buffer for optimized performance

## Objectives 🎯
1. Improve file input/ouput handling skills in C
2. Master dynamic memory allocation and static variables
3. Enhance understanding of buffer management
