# get_next_line project
The **get_next_line** project involves writing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time.

The project helps improving our skills in file input/ouput operations, dynamic memory allocation and buffer management.

By creating this function we get a deeper understanding of how to handle input efficiency in C.
## Features
- **File reading:** Read from a file descriptor one line at a time
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Efficiently manage memory for variable-length lines
- **Buffer Management:** Handle input using a static buffer for optimized performance

<u>Objectives<u>
1. Improve file input/ouput handling skills in C
2. Master dynamic memory allocation and static variables
3. Enhance understanding of buffer management

## Installation
To install the function :

git clone  git@github.com:elodieiam/get_next_line.git
